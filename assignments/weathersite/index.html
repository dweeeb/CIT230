				<h2>This is What Happens If You Surf During a Polar Vortex</h2>
			
				<img src="images/surfer_dan_crop_300w.jpg">
				
				<p>Dan Schetter, affectionately known around Michigan's Upper Peninsula as "Surfer Dan," rarely lets a good wave pass him by. He even surfed during last month's Polar Vortex as windchill in the state hovered at minus 30 degrees, a feat he warns should not be tried at home.</p>

				<p>On Lake Superior, especially during the winter, not every day makes for great surfing, and that's why Schetter isn't apt to waste a good day in the waves.</p>

				<p>"They get after it when the conditions are right because there is no certainty when the next chance they'll get to surf will be," photographer Devon Hains said of Schetter and other winter surfers. "Plus most winters the shoreline of Lake Superior will freeze up and no one can catch a wave until the ice breaks apart or thaws come springtime."</p>

				<p>"He lives for being out in the water," Hains told weather.com. "I went out on his jet skis with him last summer and photographed him jumping off a series of cliffs along the coast of Grand Island in Munising, also known as Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. I've seen a video of him doing a backflip off a cliff into a hole cut in the ice wearing only a set of boxers. These are the kinds of things that have earned him another nickname, 'Hardcore Dan.'"</p>

				<p>The surfer and his friend Allen Finau are seen in the slideshow above wearing thick wetsuits over tight layers, but Schetter's first time surfing in Lake Superior's winter waters was in just his underwear. He says he's surfed every month of the year in board shorts sans wetsuit.</p>

				<p>"Sometimes the temps are so cold that ice buildup on his board can make stand-up difficult for him, which is rare, considering I have seen him pull off several headstands on an ice-covered surf board," Hains elaborated. "Sometimes his wet suit might let a little too much cold water into a boot, and he'll just come up to shore and grab some hot water to pour into it, and he's right back out there."</p>

				<p>Shetter, who says he thinks he has surfed more than anyone on Great Lakes, may seem fearless, but he worries for others who may try to follow in his footsteps. He said he's seen surfers have to save people many times, and he's done so himself as well, even saving rescue workers. But Schetter has also had to be rescued.</p>

				<p>"I've come so close so many times, where I knew I pushed my limits," he said. "So I get really concerned about other people trying to copy... I can't save everybody. Everybody's life is in their own hands, you can't rely on somebody else... I don't want to lure anybody to their death."</p>

				<p>But the thrill of the sport is worth its risks for Schetter, and he partially credits surfing for his sobriety.</p>

				<p>"I think part of the reason I push so hard into the storms, pushing my limits, I think that brings me an attitude of gratitude for regular life, when I get bored. It really helps me appreciate simple things like a hot bath and a nice comfortable bed," he said.</p>
