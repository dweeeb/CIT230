					<h2>Here's Why the Polar Vortex Always Hits the Midwest</h2>

					<img src="images/winter_edit.jpg" alt="woman standing on road in snow storm">

					<p>As Live Science reported (and all your Chicago friends on Instagram confirmed), it's very cold in the Midwest and Plains right now. That's not just because it's winter, which is always pretty cold out there, but also because a big chunk of Arctic air (the polar vortex) has become trapped in the North American midlatitudes.</p>
					
					<p>Here's the weird thing, though: Cold as it is out there, and cold as it will soon be on the East Coast, the West Coast is doing just fine. Portland, Oregon, is about 250 miles (400 kilometers) farther north than Chicago, where, as of this writing, it's minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 26 Celsius). But Portland is a comparatively balmy 47 F (8 C). Seattle is nearly 400 miles (640 km) farther north than Chicago, but that West Coast city is currently 45 F (7 C).</p>

					<p>Now, there are a number of reasons pertaining to air currents and other factors that make the Pacific Northwest generally much more comfortable temperature-wise than the Midwest. For one, that region is often spared contact with that huge mass of Arctic air â€” as is the case on this occasion.</p>
						
					<p>A big, granite reason for that difference is the Rocky Mountains, according to Tyler Hasenstein, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Minnesota's Twin Cities region. The continent-splitting mountain chain forms a kind of buffer in the jet stream, an air current that, among other things, plays a big role in movements of the polar vortex. And the effect is to keep the polar vortex at bay. (Usually, this splat of counterclockwise-spinning Arctic air stays caged up around the North Pole, but right now, a disruption in the system is sending the blast into the U.S.)
