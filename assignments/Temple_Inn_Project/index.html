				<h1>This Month's Featured Temple</h1>

				<a href="content2.html"><img src="images/temple_600w.jpg" alt="two way radio"></a>
				
				<p>Following its dedication, the Jordan River Temple quickly became one of the busiest in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, even with the Salt Lake Temple less than 15 miles away. With attendance at the Salt Lake, Ogden and Provo temples at all-time highs in 1977, President Kimball announced plans for the Jordan River Utah Temple on Feb. 3, 1978.</p>
				
				<p>The Jordan River Temple is one of five temples featuring Moroni holding the gold plates. Tear drops are an architectural theme found in the fence and spire. Until a few years ago, the Jordan River Temple district contained 110 stakes. Following the dedication of the Draper and Oquirrh Mountain temples, that number was reduced to 68 stakes.</p>
				
				<p>President Ezra Taft Benson said the Jordan River Temple would be a light to all in the area. “This valley,” the Church News quoted President Benson “…will be protected, our families protected, our children safeguarded as we live the gospel, visit the temples and live close to the Lord.”</p>
				
				<p>Someone asked a 4-year-old what he liked best about the Jordan River Temple . . .thinking the child would say something about the decor. The child responded, “I liked all those grandmas in their nightgowns.”</p>
