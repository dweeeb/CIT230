				<p>Temple Inn and Suites began as a simple idea in the late 1970's. Temple patrons often traveled from great distances to attend temple ceremonies and rarely would they know anyone in the area. Temple Inn and Suites was envisioned as a 'temporal' place of refuge for traveling temple patrons. It didn't take long to realize that there were greater needs than just lodging. Temple Inn and Suites quickly became temporary home to many full-time temple missionaries. The need for a gospel-oriented event venue also became apparent, and Temple Inn and Suites rose to the occaision. We have been the pre-eminent venue and provider of event services for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Satins for more than 40 years. It has been our privilege to be such a large part of the most precious and special days in the lives of so many faithful Saints. Come and see why we are the most recommended venue and service provider for temple related events!</p>
